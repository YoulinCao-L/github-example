We are also particularly interested in areas with no coffee shop in the vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to the city center as possible, assuming that the first two conditions are met.\n### 1.3 Interest\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on these criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.\n\n## 2. Data acquisition and cleaning \n### 2.1 Data sources\nBased on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are: number of existing coffee shop in the neighborhood (including restaurant offer coffee), number of and,distance to other coffee shop/restaurant in the neighborhood, if any,distance of neighborhood from city center\nWe decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information: centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Maps API reverse geocoding, number of coffee shop and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API, coordinate of Stockholm center will be obtained using Google Maps API geocoding\n\n\n## 3. Data Requirements and Methodology\n\nData Acquisition Approach\nTo acquire the data mentioned above, we need to do the following:Get geolocator lat and long coordinates for Stockholm, Sweden,use Foursquare API to get a list of all venues in Stockholm,get venue name, venue ID, location, category, and perference.\n\n## 4. Methodology\n\nThe thought process behind this is that likes are a proxy for quality.  The more likes there are, the better the restaurant is.  This might be incorrect but API call issues (how many I can use for free) holds me back from getting price / rating data.  We will then bin this data into a quality categorical variables so we can cluster appropriately.\nThe gathered data (see above in Data Acquisition Approach and Data Required sections) and will create a k-means clustering algorithm that groups restaurants into 4-5 clusters so that people looking to eat in Stockholm can easily see which restaurants are the best to eat at, what cuisine is available and where in Stockholm they can look to eat.\n\n\n## 5. Results\n\nOur analysis shows that although there is a great number of restaurants in Stockholm, there are pockets of low restaurant density fairly close to city center.Another borough was identified as potentially interesting but our attention was focused on offer a combination of popularity among tourists, closeness to city center, strong socio-economic dynamics and a number of pockets of low restaurant density. After directing our attention to this more narrow area of interest we first created a dense grid of location candidates (spaced 100m appart); those locations were then filtered so that those with more than two restaurants in radius of 250m and those with a restaurant closer than 400m were removed. Result of all this is all zones containing largest number of potential new restaurant locations based on number of and distance to existing venues - both restaurants in general and Italian restaurants particularly. This, of course, does not imply that those zones are actually optimal locations for a new restaurant! Purpose of this analysis was to only provide info on areas close to Stockholm center but not crowded with existing restaurants - it is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of restaurants in any of those areas, reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new restaurant regardless of lack of competition in the area. \n\nThese are four clusters of restaurantsas follows:\n\nCluster 1\n\u2022\tCharacteristics\no\tGood quality food\no\tMostly Bar or Cafe\nCluster 2\n\u2022\tCharacteristics\no\tBelow average quality food\no\tMostly Scandinavian food\nCluster 3\n\u2022\tCharacteristics\no\tHigh quality food\no\tAmerican inspired food\nCluster 4\n\u2022\tCharacteristics\no\tAbove average quality food\no\tMostly Bars / Cafe\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nPurpose of this project was to identify Stockholm areas close to center with low number of restaurants in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new restaurant. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders. Final decision on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"collapsed": true}}, {"source": "", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3.6", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.6.8", "name": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}, "nbformat": 4}
